1. Initial Setup
Step 1.1: Select the Website
The first step in web scraping is to choose the website you want to scrape from. For this lab, a baseball_stats.html page has been provided for you, which lists betting odds and game stats. You'll be scraping this site to collect statistics for several baseball games, including:
Expected runs
Over/under bets
Moneyline favorite

Step 1.2: Launch the Development Server
In order to view and scrape the baseball_stats.html page, you’ll launch a development server from this lab environment. You will need to follow these steps each time you reboot the lab.

First, click the ‘Go Live’ button at the bottom-right of the VS Code lab window. This will start the Live Server. If you encounter issues, you can try disabling any ad-blockers or use a different web browser.

Once the Live Server has been started, click the ‘Open Development Server’ button near the bottom-left of the VS Code lab window. This will open a tab that shows the Baseball Game Statistics page on your local web browser. This is the page you will analyze and scrape for the following activities in this lab.

Step 1.3 Install Dependencies
You will be using some external libraries for this lab such as BeautifulSoup and pandas, which need to be installed. Open your terminal using ctrl-` or navigate to View -> Terminal and enter the following command:

pip install bs4 pandas lxml

When working locally, you would only have to install these libraries once. However, for this lab environment, you will need to run this command each time you reboot the lab.
